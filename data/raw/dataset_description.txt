Mangasarian, venue: Electronic imaging, year: 1993, journal: None, DOI: 10.1117/12.148698, URL: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53f0fbb425bc14468eb3bf96b2e1d41ba8087f36, 

summary: Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/


The following features were calculated for each cell in the image:

Radius: Mean distance from the center to points on the perimeter
Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
Perimeter
Area
Smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths
Compactness: (perimeter2/area)−1.0(\text{perimeter}^2 / \text{area}) - 1.0(perimeter2/area)−1.0
Concavity: Severity of concave portions of the contour
Concave points: Number of concave portions of the contour
Symmetry
Fractal dimension: “Coastline approximation” minus 1

The dataset contains features derived from these measurements. For each feature, the mean value across all cells, the standard error (standard deviation), and the worst case were computed and reported in the data.

The target feature is diagnosis (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)
